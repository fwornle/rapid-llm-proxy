/**
 * Background-daemon process identity (WIRE-03 span-leakage guard II, Phase 82-06).
 *
 * The `/api/complete` write path historically stamped `task_id` from the ambient
 * active-measurement span (`resolveLiveTaskId()`) for ANY caller that omitted an
 * explicit `body.task_id`. That fallback is correct for an interactive session
 * whose calls genuinely belong to the open span — but WRONG for the long-running
 * coding-side background daemons (the health coordinator, the consolidator
 * family, the observation writer, the token-adapter taps, the wave-analysis
 * workflow) which fire on their OWN cadence, unrelated to any measured
 * experiment cell. When a cell's span is the ambient span, those daemon calls
 * get their unrelated tokens stamped with the cell's `task_id` — the exact
 * cross-contamination Plan 82-02 killed on the `/v1/messages` tap, still
 * reproduced by the `/api/complete` ambient fallback.
 *
 * A cell's OWN agent calls always arrive with an EXPLICIT `body.task_id` (the
 * experiment runner sets `x-task-id` for claude and the `/v1/copilot/t/<id>`
 * task-scoped path / shim `X-Task-Id` for opencode & friends), so denying the
 * ambient fallback to these daemon processes can NEVER unbind a legitimate cell
 * row — it only stops a daemon from borrowing a cell's identity.
 *
 * Process identity is the discriminator: each coding-side daemon sets its
 * `process` field client-side on the `/api/complete` body. This is a DENYLIST,
 * not an allowlist — any unlisted process keeps the prior `resolveLiveTaskId()`
 * behaviour (backward compatible). Pure, never throws, no I/O.
